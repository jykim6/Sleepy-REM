# android-app
A repository for our android application. 
This Android application will allow the user to control the schedule of the window and blinds or leave it on ‘auto’ and allow our algorithms to automate the window management system. The user can set up schedules for the window and the blinds separately for each day of the week. 

Functionalities:
-Tells the time
-Allows users to set up schedules for each day
  -maybe multiple profiles?
  -Use time to open and close?
  -Specific positions can be set for each time
  -Allow to have certain days on auto
-Compare inside temperature with temperature from internet
-Send emails to microcontroller to communicate.  5-7 Minutes per email?
-User can set it to auto - user sets the temperature that the room should stay at
-Override schedule
  -User can set a certain position
  -this overrides schedule => stays in that position unless told to
-Passcode for security

Things User needs to input:
-square footage of house? or room?
-Desired temperature indoors at specific time/range of time
-0 to 10 scale for brightness (is this scale fixed or is 10 the maximum brightness the room can have from natural lighting at that given moment?)

Feel free to modify this repository or create a new one!
